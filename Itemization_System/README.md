# Itemization System Documentation

This folder contains comprehensive documentation for implementing a Stellar Blade-inspired itemization system for our AAA hack and slash game using Unreal Engine 5.

## Document Overview

### [AAA_Itemization_System.md](AAA_Itemization_System.md)
The primary document that outlines the complete itemization system architecture, components, implementation details, and roadmap. This is the main reference document for the entire system.

### [Research_Summary.md](Research_Summary.md)
An analysis of our research on Stellar Blade's item systems and how we've adapted these insights for our game, highlighting key similarities and differences.

### [Designer_Quick_Reference.md](Designer_Quick_Reference.md)
A practical guide for game designers on how to use the itemization system, including workflows, best practices, and common pitfalls to avoid.

## Key Features

- **Stellar Blade-Inspired Design**: Streamlined equipment categories with depth and meaningful progression
- **Designer-Friendly Tools**: Comprehensive creation and balancing tools for game designers
- **Flexible Architecture**: Built on our existing Inventory Pattern Library but enhanced for AAA quality
- **Performance-Optimized**: Designed with scalability and performance in mind
- **Visually Engaging**: Strong emphasis on visual feedback for upgrades and progression

## Getting Started

1. Start with the [Research_Summary.md](Research_Summary.md) to understand the design philosophy
2. Review the complete system in [AAA_Itemization_System.md](AAA_Itemization_System.md)
3. Refer to [Designer_Quick_Reference.md](Designer_Quick_Reference.md) for practical implementation guidance

## Implementation Status

This documentation represents the planning phase of the itemization system. Implementation will follow the roadmap outlined in the main document:

- **Phase 1 (1-2 months)**: Core foundations
- **Phase 2 (2-3 months)**: Main systems
- **Phase 3 (2-3 months)**: Enhancement and polish
- **Phase 4 (3-4 months)**: Content creation and balancing

## Next Steps

1. Review and finalize this documentation
2. Begin prototyping the Item Creation Dashboard
3. Implement core data structures for equipment categories
4. Create sample items for initial testing
5. Develop the first version of designer tools
