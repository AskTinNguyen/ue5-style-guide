# AI-Assisted C++ Pattern Library: Character Systems

This collection provides reusable design patterns and code examples for implementing character and player systems in Unreal Engine 5 using C++. Each pattern includes a problem definition, solution approach, sample code, AI prompt templates, and integration tips.

## Pattern Index

### [1. Character Component Framework](Pattern1_CharacterComponents.md)
A modular approach to character functionality using components for abilities, stats, and state management.

### [2. Movement and Controls](Pattern2_MovementControls.md)
Advanced movement system with custom input handling, movement modes, and state-based locomotion.

### [3. Character Progression](Pattern3_CharacterProgression.md)
Systems for managing character stats, experience, levels, and skill trees with proper persistence.

### [4. Character Customization](Pattern4_CharacterCustomization.md)
Framework for handling character appearance, equipment visualization, and runtime mesh/material modifications.

### [5. Player State Management](Pattern5_PlayerState.md)
Robust state management system for handling player data, persistence, and network synchronization.

## How to Use This Library

1. **Understand the Problem**: Each pattern starts with a clear problem statement to help you identify the right solution.

2. **Review the Code**: Examine the provided C++ class implementations and adapt them to your project needs.

3. **Leverage AI Assistance**: Use the AI prompt templates when you need help implementing or extending the patterns.

4. **Integration Tips**: Follow the integration guidelines to effectively connect these systems with your existing codebase.

5. **Performance Considerations**: Pay attention to the performance notes to ensure your implementation remains efficient.

## Best Practices

1. **Component-Based Design**: Use components to encapsulate distinct character features.

2. **State Management**: Implement clear state transitions and validation.

3. **Network Replication**: Design systems with multiplayer considerations from the start.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Balance feature richness with performance impact.

5. **Animation Integration**: Create clean interfaces between gameplay and animation systems.

## Further Development

These patterns can be extended in various ways:

- Add advanced ragdoll physics integration
- Implement character personality and behavior systems
- Create dynamic attribute modification system
- Add advanced animation state machines
- Implement character relationship systems

## Integration with Other Systems
