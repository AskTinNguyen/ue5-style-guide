# AI-Assisted C++ Pattern Library: Save/Load Systems

This collection provides reusable design patterns and code examples for implementing save/load systems in Unreal Engine 5 using C++. Each pattern includes a problem definition, solution approach, sample code, AI prompt templates, and integration tips.

## Pattern Index

### [1. Save Data Architecture](Pattern1_SaveDataArchitecture.md)
Flexible and extensible save data structure design with versioning and backward compatibility support.

### [2. Serialization Framework](Pattern2_SerializationFramework.md)
Robust serialization system for game objects, components, and states with custom data type support.

### [3. Async Save System](Pattern3_AsyncSaveSystem.md)
Asynchronous save/load operations with progress tracking and error handling.

### [4. Save State Management](Pattern4_SaveStateManagement.md)
System for managing multiple save slots, auto-saves, and save state validation.

### [5. Cross-Platform Persistence](Pattern5_CrossPlatformPersistence.md)
Platform-independent save data handling with cloud save support and conflict resolution.

## How to Use This Library
