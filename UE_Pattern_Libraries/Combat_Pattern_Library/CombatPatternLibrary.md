# AI-Assisted C++ Pattern Library: Combat Systems

This collection provides reusable design patterns and code examples for implementing combat systems in Unreal Engine 5 C++ games. Each pattern includes a problem definition, solution approach, sample code, AI prompt templates, and integration tips.

## Pattern Index

### [1. Damage System Implementation](Pattern1_DamageSystem.md)
A flexible data-driven approach to damage calculation and application. Includes struct-based damage data, processing pipeline, and support for different damage types.

### [2. Hit Detection and Collision](Pattern2_HitDetection.md)
Robust hit detection for melee weapons and projectiles. Features sweep-based detection, collision filtering, and integration with animation systems.

### [3. Status Effect System](Pattern3_StatusEffects.md)
Component-based system for managing temporary buffs, debuffs, and status effects with stacking, duration management, and visual feedback.

### [4. Target Lock System](Pattern4_TargetLockSystem.md)
Third-person target locking (lock-on) system with target selection, switching between targets, and camera positioning.

### [5. Combat Animation State Management](Pattern5_CombatAnimationManagement.md)
Animation state machine for complex combat animations with combo systems, hit reactions, and animation-gameplay synchronization.

## How to Use This Library

1. **Understand the Problem**: Each pattern starts with a clear problem statement to help you identify the right solution.

2. **Review the Code**: Examine the provided C++ class implementations and adapt them to your project needs.

3. **Leverage AI Assistance**: Use the AI prompt templates when you need help implementing or extending the patterns.

4. **Integration Tips**: Follow the integration guidelines to effectively connect these systems with your existing codebase.

5. **Performance Considerations**: Pay attention to the performance notes to ensure your implementation remains efficient.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Implement the basic pattern first, then gradually add complexity.

2. **Test Thoroughly**: Combat systems are core gameplay mechanics and require comprehensive testing.

3. **Blueprint Exposure**: Expose key parameters to Blueprints for designers to tune without coding.

4. **Modular Approach**: Keep systems decoupled so they can be independently improved or replaced.

5. **Network Considerations**: Always account for multiplayer replication when implementing these patterns.

## Further Development

These patterns represent starting points that you can extend in various ways:

- Add data-driven configuration via data assets
- Create Blueprint-based visual editors for designers
- Implement runtime debugging visualization
- Extend with gameplay ability system integration
- Add machine learning for enemy combat behaviors
