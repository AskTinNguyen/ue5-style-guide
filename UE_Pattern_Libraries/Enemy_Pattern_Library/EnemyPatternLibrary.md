# AI-Assisted C++ Pattern Library: Enemy Systems

This collection provides specialized design patterns and code examples for implementing scalable enemy systems in a AAA hack and slash game using Unreal Engine 5 and C++. These patterns are designed to work alongside the Character Pattern Library while addressing enemy-specific requirements.

## Pattern Index

### [1. Enemy Base Framework](Pattern1_EnemyBase.md)
Core architecture for enemy inheritance, component organization, and base functionality that supports up to 100+ enemy types.

### [2. Enemy Combat & Ability System](Pattern2_EnemyCombat.md)
Modular combat system for defining enemy attacks, abilities, and combat behaviors with inheritance support.

### [3. Enemy Spawning & Management](Pattern3_EnemySpawning.md)
Comprehensive system for enemy spawning, pooling, territory management, and encounter orchestration.

### [4. Enemy Data-Driven Design](Pattern4_EnemyData.md)
Framework enabling non-engineers to create and modify enemy content through data assets and visual tools.

### [5. Enemy AI Integration](Pattern5_EnemyAI.md)
Patterns for seamless integration between C++ systems and Behavior Trees, including reusable AI building blocks.

### [6. Enemy Progression & Scaling](Pattern6_EnemyProgression.md)
Systems for managing enemy difficulty, level scaling, and dynamic adjustment based on game progression.
