# AI-Assisted C++ Pattern Library: Inventory Systems

This collection provides reusable design patterns and code examples for implementing inventory systems in Unreal Engine 5 using C++. Each pattern includes a problem definition, solution approach, sample code, AI prompt templates, and integration tips.

## Pattern Index

### [1. Item Data Management](Pattern1_ItemDataManagement.md)
A flexible data-driven system for managing item definitions, properties, and metadata using UE5's data assets and interfaces.

### [2. Container System](Pattern2_ContainerSystem.md)
Modular inventory container implementation supporting different storage types, stack management, and item organization.

### [3. Item Interaction Framework](Pattern3_ItemInteraction.md)
System for handling item pickup, drop, use, and equipment with proper networking and animation support.

### [4. Inventory UI Integration](Pattern4_InventoryUI.md)
Patterns for creating responsive inventory interfaces with drag-drop support, tooltips, and context menus.

### [5. Persistence and Serialization](Pattern5_InventoryPersistence.md)
Robust save/load system for inventory data with support for different storage formats and versioning.

## How to Use This Library

1. **Understand the Problem**: Each pattern starts with a clear problem statement to help you identify the right solution.

2. **Review the Code**: Examine the provided C++ class implementations and adapt them to your project needs.

3. **Leverage AI Assistance**: Use the AI prompt templates when you need help implementing or extending the patterns.

4. **Integration Tips**: Follow the integration guidelines to effectively connect these systems with your existing codebase.

5. **Performance Considerations**: Pay attention to the performance notes to ensure your implementation remains efficient.

## Best Practices

1. **Data-Driven Design**: Use data assets and scriptable objects for item definitions and properties.

2. **Modular Architecture**: Keep inventory components decoupled and independently testable.

3. **Blueprint Exposure**: Expose key functionality to Blueprints for designer control.

4. **Network Considerations**: Design with multiplayer in mind from the start.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Implement efficient storage and lookup mechanisms.

## Further Development

These patterns can be extended in various ways:

- Add crafting and item modification systems
- Implement economy and trading systems
- Create advanced sorting and filtering mechanisms
- Add inventory space optimization algorithms
- Implement item degradation and repair systems
