# UMG Widget Pattern Library

This library provides comprehensive design patterns, guidelines, and reference code for creating Unreal Engine UMG widgets using C++. The goal is to help developers create UMG widgets quickly and efficiently while following best practices.

## Overview

Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG) is Unreal Engine's UI design and implementation system. This pattern library focuses on creating UMG widgets using C++ rather than Blueprint, which offers better performance, version control, and maintainability for complex projects.

## Contents

1. [Widget Base Classes](Pattern1_WidgetBaseClasses.md) - Foundation classes for different widget types
2. [Data Binding Patterns](Pattern2_DataBindingPatterns.md) - Efficient ways to connect data to UI
3. [Widget Factory System](Pattern3_WidgetFactorySystem.md) - Centralized widget creation and management
4. [Responsive Design](Pattern4_ResponsiveDesign.md) - Adapting widgets to different screen sizes and resolutions
5. [Widget Animation in C++](Pattern5_WidgetAnimationCPP.md) - Implementing and controlling UMG animations via code
6. [Widget Interaction](Pattern6_WidgetInteraction.md) - Handling input and user interaction
7. [Performance Optimization](Pattern7_PerformanceOptimization.md) - Best practices for efficient UMG widgets

## Getting Started

If you're new to UMG widget development in C++, we recommend starting with the [Widget Base Classes](Pattern1_WidgetBaseClasses.md) pattern, which provides the foundation for all other patterns in this library.

## Best Practices Summary

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep widget logic separate from game logic
- **Reusability**: Design widgets to be reusable across different contexts
- **Performance**: Be mindful of widget creation, destruction, and update costs
- **Maintainability**: Use consistent naming conventions and organization
- **Scalability**: Design widget systems that can scale with project complexity

## Integration with Other Systems

The UMG Widget Pattern Library works in conjunction with:

- [UI Pattern Library](../UI_Pattern_Library/UIPatternLibrary.md) - General UI system patterns
- [Save/Load Pattern Library](../Save_Load_Pattern_Library) - For persisting UI states and preferences
- [Character Pattern Library](../Character_Pattern_Library) - For character-specific UI elements

## Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to this pattern library, please ensure your examples:

1. Follow the [UE5 C++ Style Guide](../UE5-CPP-Style-Guide.md)
2. Include clear comments explaining the purpose of each component
3. Provide both minimal examples and real-world use cases
4. Consider performance implications, especially for mobile platforms
5. Include visual references or diagrams where appropriate
