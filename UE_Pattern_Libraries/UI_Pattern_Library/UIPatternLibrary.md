# AI-Assisted C++ Pattern Library: UI/UX Systems

This collection provides reusable design patterns and code examples for implementing UI/UX systems in Unreal Engine 5 using C++ and UMG. Each pattern includes a problem definition, solution approach, sample code, AI prompt templates, and integration tips.

## Pattern Index

### [1. Responsive Widget Base](Pattern1_ResponsiveWidgetBase.md)
A flexible base widget class that handles responsive layouts across different screen sizes and aspect ratios.

### [2. Data-Binding Widget](Pattern2_DataBindingWidget.md)
Pattern for binding game data to UI elements with automatic updates when data changes.

### [3. Animated UI Components](Pattern3_AnimatedUIComponents.md)
Create smooth, reusable widget animations with C++ for transitions, feedback, and visual effects.

### [4. Input-Driven UI Management](Pattern4_InputDrivenUIManagement.md)
System for handling UI navigation, focus, and input across multiple widget layers.

### [5. Game HUD Framework](Pattern5_GameHUDFramework.md)
Extensible HUD system with support for gameplay elements, notifications, and contextual information.

## How to Use This Library

1. **Understand the Problem**: Each pattern starts with a clear problem statement to help you identify the right solution.

2. **Review the Code**: Examine the provided C++ class implementations and adapt them to your project needs.

3. **Leverage AI Assistance**: Use the AI prompt templates when you need help implementing or extending the patterns.

4. **Integration Tips**: Follow the integration guidelines to effectively connect these systems with your existing codebase.

5. **Performance Considerations**: Pay attention to the performance notes to ensure your implementation remains efficient.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Implement the basic pattern first, then gradually add complexity.

2. **Test Across Platforms**: Test UI layouts on all target platforms and screen sizes early in development.

3. **Blueprint Exposure**: Expose key parameters to Blueprints for designers to tune without coding.

4. **Modular Approach**: Create reusable widget components that can be combined to build complex interfaces.

5. **Accessibility**: Consider keyboard navigation, controller support, and text scaling in your design.

## Further Development

These patterns represent starting points that you can extend in various ways:

- Add internationalization and localization support
- Implement advanced theming and style system
- Create analytics tracking for UI interactions
- Add input customization and rebinding interfaces
- Develop specialized widgets for VR/AR interfaces
