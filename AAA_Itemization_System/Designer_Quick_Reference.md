# Game Designer's Quick Reference: Itemization System

This quick reference guide provides an overview of how to use the itemization system for our AAA hack and slash game. It covers the primary workflows, key concepts, and best practices for creating and balancing items.

## Core Concepts

### Item Categories

Our itemization system is divided into five main categories:

1. **Weapons**: The player's primary combat tools
2. **Exospines**: Specialized equipment providing unique buffs and abilities
3. **Gear**: Passive stat enhancers and effect modifiers
4. **Outfits/Nano Suits**: Visual customization with minor stat effects
5. **Consumables & Resources**: Temporary items and upgrade materials

### Rarity & Quality System

- **Common (⭐)**: Basic items with single properties
- **Uncommon (⭐⭐)**: Enhanced items with 1-2 properties
- **Rare (⭐⭐⭐)**: Superior items with 2-3 properties and minor special effects
- **Epic (⭐⭐⭐⭐)**: Exceptional items with 3-4 properties and major special effects
- **Legendary (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)**: Supreme items with 4-5 properties and unique abilities

### Progressive Upgrade System

- Items can be upgraded through collected materials
- Each upgrade level increases stats and may unlock new abilities
- Visual changes accompany significant upgrade milestones
- Branching upgrade paths allow for specialization

## Designer Workflows

### Creating New Items

1. Open the Item Creation Dashboard
2. Select the item category you want to create
3. Choose a template or start from scratch
4. Define basic properties (name, description, icon)
5. Set core stats and attributes
6. Define special abilities or effects
7. Set upgrade paths and requirements
8. Preview in 3D viewer and test effects
9. Save to the item database

### Balancing Items

1. Use the Balance Analysis tool to compare with existing items
2. Check the item's power curve against expected progression
3. Verify material costs against rarity and power
4. Test in simulated combat scenarios
5. Adjust stats and effects as needed
6. Document design intent in the notes section

### Defining Upgrade Paths

1. Open the Upgrade Path Editor for the item
2. Define upgrade levels (typically 3-5)
3. Set requirements for each level (materials, currency)
4. Define stat increases per level
5. Add special effects or abilities at key levels
6. Set visual changes at significant milestones
7. Preview the complete upgrade path
8. Save changes to the item

## Best Practices

### Item Creation

- **Start with templates** for consistent item design
- **Use descriptive names** that reflect function and theme
- **Create distinctive visuals** for important items
- **Keep special effects focused** on specific gameplay benefits
- **Document your design intent** in the notes section

### Balance Considerations

- **Check progression curves** to ensure smooth power scaling
- **Verify acquisition timing** aligns with difficulty progression
- **Balance resource costs** with player progression
- **Create meaningful choices** between items of similar power
- **Test builds with different combinations** of equipment

### Upgrade Design

- **Make each upgrade meaningful** with noticeable benefits
- **Create visual feedback** for major upgrades
- **Balance material requirements** with player progression
- **Design interesting choices** in branching upgrade paths
- **Consider special upgrades** for completing challenging content

## Quick Tips

- Use the **Item Cloner** to quickly create variations of existing items
- The **Power Calculator** shows DPS and effective health with current stats
- **Bulk Edit Mode** allows changing properties across multiple items
- **Test Loadouts** can simulate different equipment combinations
- **Version History** tracks changes to items for rollback if needed

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Power creep**: Constantly increasing power without consideration for balance
- **Empty choices**: Creating items that are clearly inferior in all ways
- **Complexity overload**: Adding too many special effects to a single item
- **Resource imbalance**: Making upgrade costs inconsistent with item power
- **Invisible progression**: Upgrades that don't provide noticeable improvements

## Example Workflow: Creating a Legendary Weapon

1. Open Item Creation Dashboard
2. Select "Weapon" category
3. Choose "Legendary Weapon" template
4. Set basic properties:
   - Name: "Stellar Fang"
   - Description: "A legendary blade forged from celestial metal"
   - Icon: Select or import custom icon
5. Set core stats:
   - Base Damage: 75-85
   - Attack Speed: Fast
   - Critical Rate: 15%
6. Add special abilities:
   - "Celestial Strike": Special attack that deals area damage
   - "Star Metal": Passive that increases damage against bosses
7. Define upgrade path (5 levels):
   - Each level increases base damage by 15%
   - Level 3 enhances Celestial Strike with a stun effect
   - Level 5 adds a new special move "Cosmic Slash"
8. Set visual transformation:
   - Base form: Simple glowing blade
   - Level 3: Enhanced energy effects
   - Level 5: Complete visual transformation with unique effects
9. Test in simulation
10. Adjust balance if needed
11. Save to item database

Remember that creating memorable items is as much about unique gameplay feel and visual identity as it is about raw stats. Focus on making items that players will remember and enjoy using!

## Item Interaction System

### Available Interaction Types
- **Pickup**: Basic item collection
- **Examine**: Detailed item inspection with 3D view
- **Equip**: Direct equipment of compatible items
- **Use Consumable**: Immediate item usage
- **Upgrade Material**: Use in upgrade station
- **Store**: Place in storage container
- **Drop**: Release item into world
- **Dismantle**: Break down for materials

### Interaction Points

#### Upgrade Stations
- Can be configured for specific item types (weapons, exospines, gear)
- Set material efficiency bonuses per station
- Place strategically for player convenience

#### Equipment Inspection
- Allows detailed 3D viewing of items
- Zoom and rotate functionality
- Shows complete item statistics
- Useful for comparing items

### Container Types

#### Player Inventory
- **Weapon Slots**: Limited to 3 slots
- **Exospine Slots**: 6 slots available
- **Gear Storage**: 20 slots for armor pieces
- **Outfit Storage**: 10 slots for cosmetic items
- **Consumable Storage**: 15 slots
- **Material Storage**: 30 slots with stacking

#### Equipment Container
- **Primary Weapon Slot**: Single active weapon
- **Exospine Slots**: Two active exospine modifications
- **Outfit Slot**: Current character appearance

#### Storage Containers
- World containers for additional storage
- Can be restricted by item type
- Configurable capacity

### Best Practices for Item Placement

1. **Upgrade Stations**
   - Place near major checkpoints
   - Consider material discount percentages for progression
   - Enable specific upgrade types based on area theme

2. **World Items**
   - Use appropriate visual effects for rarity
   - Consider auto-collect radius for materials
   - Implement proper collision for interaction zones

3. **Storage Containers**
   - Strategic placement for inventory management
   - Clear visual indication of container type
   - Appropriate capacity for area progression

### Quick Tips for Item Interaction Design

1. **Visual Feedback**
   - Use glow effects for interactive items
   - Scale effects with item rarity
   - Implement clear interaction prompts

2. **Interaction Timing**
   - Keep basic pickups instant
   - Add meaningful animations for important items
   - Consider interaction cancellation for longer animations

3. **Container Organization**
   - Group similar items automatically
   - Implement smart sorting options
   - Show capacity limits clearly

4. **Upgrade Station Design**
   - Clear upgrade paths
   - Visual feedback during upgrades
   - Proper material cost display

### Common Implementation Pitfalls

1. **Interaction Zones**
   - Too small/large interaction radius
   - Unclear interaction prompts
   - Conflicting interaction types

2. **Container Management**
   - Overcrowded storage areas
   - Unclear container purposes
   - Poor item organization

3. **Upgrade Stations**
   - Insufficient material feedback
   - Unclear upgrade requirements
   - Poor station placement

### Example: Setting Up an Elite Weapon Drop

```
Location: Boss Arena
Item: Stellar Fang (Legendary Weapon)
Setup:
1. Place WorldItemActor with appropriate mesh
2. Configure glow effect (Legendary tier)
3. Set interaction radius (larger for important items)
4. Add pickup animation sequence
5. Configure auto-equipment option
```

### Example: Configuring an Upgrade Station

```
Location: Main Hub
Configuration:
1. Enable weapon and exospine upgrades
2. Set 10% material discount
3. Add appropriate visual effects
4. Configure interaction prompt
5. Set up upgrade UI trigger
```
