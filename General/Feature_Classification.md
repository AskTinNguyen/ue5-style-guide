# Feature Classification Guide

This document classifies features in our UE5 project as either **Core** or **Advanced**. This classification helps teams prioritize implementation and prevents smaller or newer teams from being overwhelmed by features they may not immediately need.

## Classification Definitions

### Core Features
Core features are essential for basic gameplay functionality. These should be implemented first and are required for a minimum viable product.

### Advanced Features
Advanced features enhance gameplay but are not essential for basic functionality. These can be implemented later in the development cycle or skipped entirely for smaller projects.

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **For Small Teams (1-5 people)**:
   - Focus exclusively on Core Features
   - Implement only the Advanced Features that are critical to your game concept

2. **For Medium Teams (5-15 people)**:
   - Implement all Core Features first
   - Prioritize Advanced Features based on gameplay importance
   - Consider using marketplace assets for some Advanced Features

3. **For Large Teams (15+ people)**:
   - Implement all Core Features with high polish
   - Assign specialized team members to Advanced Features
   - Consider custom implementations of all features for maximum control

## Feature Dependency Map

Some features depend on others. Here's a simplified dependency map:
