# Master Project Tracker

This document provides a universal overview of our UE5 Style Guide project. It should be referenced at the start of every coding session to maintain a consistent understanding of the project's current state and progress.

## Project Overview

The UE5 Style Guide is a comprehensive collection of best practices, patterns, and guidelines for Unreal Engine 5 development. It aims to standardize development practices across teams and improve code quality, maintainability, and collaboration.

## Current Focus

The team is currently focused on:

1. Improving documentation accessibility for new team members
2. Adding visual aids to complex systems
3. Centralizing common best practices
4. Clearly labeling core vs. advanced features
5. Adding real-world integration notes
6. Developing comprehensive beginner-friendly C++ guides
7. Refining and consolidating optimization guidelines for clarity and reduced redundancy
8. Creating comprehensive UMG widget patterns and guidelines for C++ implementation
9. Optimizing the development pipeline for AI-assisted C++ development

## Next Steps

1. Complete the Beginner's Guide to C++ in UE5
2. Create Editor Utility Widgets for common tasks
3. Develop automated testing tools for style guide compliance
4. Create video tutorials for key systems
5. Implement example projects demonstrating the style guide in action
6. Add practical examples to optimization guidelines
7. Create a comprehensive guide for using Cursor AI with UE5 C++ development
8. Develop templates for common AI-assisted development patterns
