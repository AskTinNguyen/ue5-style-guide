System Architecture Prompt
Design a flexible [system type] system for our UE5 project. The system should:
1. Handle [specific functionality]
2. Be extensible without modifying existing code
3. Follow our C++ Style Guide
4. Use a data-driven approach
5. Minimize rebuild times by isolating implementation details from headers

Please provide the high-level architecture including key classes, their relationships, and example usage.
