# UE5 AI-Assisted Development Prompts

This directory contains prompt templates and guides for AI-assisted development in our UE5 project, with a focus on Cursor AI IDE integration.

## Contents

- **[CursorAI_UE5_Guide.md](CursorAI_UE5_Guide.md)**: Comprehensive guide for using Cursor AI with UE5 C++ development, including setup instructions, best practices, and troubleshooting.

- **[UE5_Prompt_Templates.md](UE5_Prompt_Templates.md)**: Collection of effective prompt templates for common UE5 development tasks, organized by category.

- **[ThinkInDraft.md](ThinkInDraft.md)**: Placeholder for draft thinking and brainstorming with AI.

## How to Use

1. Begin each Cursor AI coding session by referencing the project's MasterProjectTracker.md for context
2. Select appropriate prompt templates from UE5_Prompt_Templates.md based on your task
3. Customize the prompts with specific details about your implementation needs
4. Follow the guidelines in CursorAI_UE5_Guide.md to maximize effectiveness

## Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed instructions in your prompts
- **Reference Existing Code**: Point AI to similar code in the project when possible
- **Prioritize Headers**: Design headers for stability and minimize implementation details
- **Iterate Incrementally**: Make small, focused changes that can be tested quickly
- **Document AI Solutions**: Update documentation when AI helps solve complex problems

## Contributing

To add new prompts or improve existing ones:

1. Test your prompt in actual development
