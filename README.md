# UE5 Style Guide

A comprehensive collection of best practices, patterns, and guidelines for Unreal Engine 5 development.

## Purpose

This style guide aims to standardize development practices across teams and improve code quality, maintainability, and collaboration in Unreal Engine 5 projects.

## Getting Started

For new team members or those looking for quick reference, start with these documents:

1. [Master Project Tracker](MasterProjectTracker.md) - Universal overview of the project
2. [Starter Guide](Starter_Guide.md) - Quick start guide for common tasks
3. [Visual Diagrams](Visual_Diagrams.md) - Visual representations of key systems
4. [Feature Classification](Feature_Classification.md) - Core vs. Advanced feature labeling

## Key Documents

- [Global Best Practices](Global_Best_Practices.md) - Centralized best practices
- [UE5 C++ Style Guide](UE_Pattern_Libraries/UE5-CPP-Style-Guide.md) - C++ coding standards
- [Enemy System](Enemy_Content_Design/AAA_Enemy_System.md) - Enemy creation and behavior
- [Itemization System](Itemization_System/AAA_Itemization_System.md) - Item creation and management

## Pattern Libraries

- [AI Pattern Library](UE_Pattern_Libraries/AI_Pattern_Library) - AI behavior patterns
- [Combat Pattern Library](UE_Pattern_Libraries/Combat_Pattern_Library) - Combat system patterns
- [Character Pattern Library](UE_Pattern_Libraries/Character_Pattern_Library) - Character creation patterns
- [Inventory Pattern Library](UE_Pattern_Libraries/Inventory_Pattern_Library) - Inventory system patterns
- [Save/Load Pattern Library](UE_Pattern_Libraries/Save_Load_Pattern_Library) - Save/Load system patterns
- [UI Pattern Library](UE_Pattern_Libraries/UI_Pattern_Library) - UI system patterns

## Recent Improvements

- Added a high-level Starter Guide for quick implementation paths
- Incorporated visual diagrams for major systems
- Labeled features as Core vs. Advanced to help teams prioritize
- Added real-world integration notes
- Centralized repetitive best practices
- Added example pipelines for common development workflows
