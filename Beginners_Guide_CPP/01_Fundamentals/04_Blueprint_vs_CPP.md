# Blueprint vs C++: When to Use Each

## Overview

This guide helps you understand when to use C++ versus Blueprints in your Unreal Engine 5 hack and slash game. Both approaches have their strengths, and knowing when to use each will make your development more efficient.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, you should:
- Have completed the [UE5 Class Hierarchy](03_UE5_Class_Hierarchy.md) guide
- Have basic knowledge of both C++ and Blueprints
- Understand UE5's component system

## Comparing Blueprints and C++

### Blueprints
Advantages:
- Visual scripting system
- Rapid prototyping
- No compilation required
- Great for designers
- Easy to visualize flow
- Built-in debugging visualization

Disadvantages:
- Can be slower than C++
- Can become messy with complexity
- Limited access to low-level features
- Performance overhead
- Version control challenges

### C++
Advantages:
- Better performance
- Full engine access
- Better version control
- More structured code
- Better for complex systems
- Industry standard

Disadvantages:
- Requires compilation
- Steeper learning curve
- Less visual feedback
- Harder to debug for beginners
- Can be overkill for simple tasks

## When to Use Each

### Use Blueprints For:

1. **Rapid Prototyping**
   - Quick gameplay mechanics testing
   - UI layouts and interactions
   - Simple state machines
   - Quick iterations on game rules

2. **Visual-Heavy Systems**
   - Particle effects control
   - Animation state machines
   - Material parameter control
   - Camera behavior

3. **Designer-Driven Content**
   - Level-specific logic
   - Event sequences
   - Simple AI behavior trees
   - Quick parameter tweaking

### Use C++ For:

1. **Core Systems**
   ```cpp
   // Example: Core combat system
   UCLASS()
   class MYGAME_API UCombatSystem : public UObject
   {
       GENERATED_BODY()
       
   public:
       // Complex damage calculations
       float CalculateDamage(const FAttackData& AttackData, const FDefenseData& DefenseData);
       
       // Hitbox detection system
       TArray<AActor*> PerformHitboxTrace(const FVector& Start, const FVector& End);
   };
   ```

2. **Performance-Critical Features**
   ```cpp
   // Example: Optimized enemy spawning system
   UCLASS()
   class MYGAME_API AEnemyManager : public AActor
   {
       GENERATED_BODY()
       
   private:
       // Efficient enemy pool
       TArray<AEnemy*> EnemyPool;
       
       // Fast enemy lookup
       TMap<FName, AEnemy*> EnemyLookup;
   };
   ```

3. **Complex Algorithms**
   ```cpp
   // Example: Advanced pathfinding
   UCLASS()
   class MYGAME_API UCustomPathfinding : public UObject
   {
       GENERATED_BODY()
       
   public:
       // Complex path calculation
       TArray<FVector> CalculateOptimalPath(const FVector& Start, const FVector& End);
   };
   ```

## Best Practices for Hybrid Approach

### 1. Create C++ Base Classes
```cpp
// Create base functionality in C++
UCLASS(Blueprintable)
class MYGAME_API ABaseWeapon : public AActor
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    
protected:
    // Core functionality in C++
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)
    virtual float CalculateBaseDamage();
    
    // Extendable in Blueprints
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent)
    void OnWeaponSwing();
};
```

### 2. Extend in Blueprints
- Create Blueprint child classes for specific variations
- Override virtual functions for unique behavior
- Add visual effects and feedback
- Implement simple logic variations

### 3. Use Blueprint Interfaces
```cpp
// Define interface in C++
UINTERFACE(MinimalAPI, Blueprintable)
class UDamageable : public UInterface
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
};

class IDamageable
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    
public:
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintNativeEvent)
    void TakeDamage(float Amount);
};
```

## Common Scenarios in Hack and Slash Games

### 1. Combat System
```cpp
// Core combat in C++
UCLASS()
class MYGAME_API UCombatComponent : public UActorComponent
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    
public:
    // Complex hit detection and damage calculation
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)
    void ProcessAttack(const FAttackData& AttackData);
    
    // Blueprint-extendable effects
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent)
    void OnHitSuccessful(AActor* HitActor);
};
```

### 2. Animation System
- Use C++ for:
  - Animation state machine logic
  - Performance-critical calculations
  - Core animation interfaces

- Use Blueprints for:
  - Animation blending
  - State transitions
  - Visual feedback
  - Quick iterations

### 3. AI System
```cpp
// Core AI in C++
UCLASS()
class MYGAME_API AEnemyAI : public AAIController
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    
protected:
    // Complex pathfinding and decision making
    virtual void UpdatePathfinding();
    
    // Blueprint-extendable behavior
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent)
    void OnPlayerSpotted();
};
```

## Decision Making Framework

Ask these questions when choosing between C++ and Blueprints:

1. **Performance Requirements**
   - Is this code running every frame?
   - Does it involve complex calculations?
   - Are there many instances of this object?

2. **Iteration Speed Needs**
   - How often will this need to change?
   - Who needs to modify this system?
   - Is visual debugging important?

3. **Complexity Level**
   - How many operations are involved?
   - Are there complex data structures?
   - Does it require low-level engine access?

4. **Team Considerations**
   - Who will maintain this code?
   - Do designers need to modify it?
   - Is it part of a shared system?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-Engineering in C++**
   ```cpp
   // Don't create complex C++ classes for simple things
   // Bad: Simple pickup in C++
   class MYGAME_API AHealthPickup : public AActor
   {
       // Lots of complex C++ for a simple pickup
   };
   
   // Better: Use Blueprint for simple pickup logic
   ```

2. **Complex Blueprint Logic**
   ```cpp
   // Create C++ functions for complex operations
   UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)
   float CalculateComplexDamage(const TArray<FBuffData>& Buffs);
   ```

3. **Mixed Responsibilities**
   - Keep C++ and Blueprint responsibilities clear
   - Don't split single features across both without good reason
   - Document where functionality lives
