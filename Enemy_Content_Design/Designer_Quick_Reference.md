# Game Designer's Quick Reference: Enemy System

This quick reference guide provides an overview of how to use the enemy system for our AAA hack and slash game. It covers the primary workflows, key concepts, and best practices for creating and balancing enemies inspired by Stellar Blade's combat-focused approach.

## Core Concepts

### Enemy Categories

Our enemy system is divided into five main hierarchies:

1. **Naytiba Minions**: Basic enemies that pose limited threat individually but can be dangerous in groups
2. **Naytiba Warriors**: Standard combat enemies with defined attack patterns and moderate threat level
3. **Elite Naytiba**: Specialized mini-boss enemies with unique abilities and substantial health pools
4. **Alpha Naytiba**: Major boss enemies with complex, multi-phase combat encounters
5. **Elder Naytiba**: Ultimate boss enemies with story significance and exceptional combat challenges

### Enemy Rarity & Threat System

- **Common (⭐)**: Basic enemies with single attack patterns
- **Uncommon (⭐⭐)**: Enhanced enemies with 1-2 attack patterns
- **Rare (⭐⭐⭐)**: Superior enemies with 2-3 attack patterns and minor special abilities
- **Epic (⭐⭐⭐⭐)**: Exceptional enemies with 3-4 attack patterns and major special abilities
- **Legendary (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)**: Supreme boss enemies with 4-5 attack patterns and unique mechanics

### Enemy Evolution System

- Enemies can evolve through exposure to different environments
- Each evolution level modifies existing attacks and may unlock new abilities
- Visual changes accompany significant evolution milestones
- Specialized variants offer distinct challenge levels

## Designer Workflows

### Creating New Enemies

1. Open the Enemy Creation Dashboard
2. Select the enemy category you want to create
3. Choose a template or start from scratch
4. Define basic properties (name, description, visual design)
5. Set core stats and attributes
6. Define attack patterns and special abilities
7. Set behavior trees and AI patterns
8. Preview in 3D viewer and test combat scenarios
9. Save to the enemy database

### Balancing Enemies

1. Use the Combat Analysis tool to compare with existing enemies
2. Check the enemy's threat level against expected progression
3. Verify HP, damage output, and aggression levels
4. Test in simulated combat scenarios
5. Adjust stats and abilities as needed
6. Document design intent in the notes section

### Defining Behavior Patterns

1. Open the Behavior Pattern Editor for the enemy
2. Define core behavior states (idle, patrol, combat, retreat)
3. Set transition conditions between states
4. Define attack patterns and combos
5. Add special abilities and conditions for their use
6. Configure group behavior and coordination
7. Preview the complete behavior tree
8. Save changes to the enemy

## Best Practices

### Enemy Creation

- **Start with templates** for consistent enemy design
- **Use descriptive names** that reflect function and theme
- **Create distinctive silhouettes** for better player recognition
- **Keep special abilities focused** on specific combat challenges
- **Document your design intent** in the notes section

### Balance Considerations

- **Check progression curves** to ensure smooth difficulty scaling
- **Consider encounter composition** when balancing individual enemies
- **Balance HP and damage output** with player progression
- **Create meaningful combat engagement** requiring specific player tactics
- **Test encounters with different player loadouts** and skill levels

### Behavior Design

- **Make each attack readable** with clear telegraphs
- **Create visual feedback** for state transitions
- **Balance aggression levels** with player progression
- **Design interesting attack combinations** that challenge player skills
- **Consider special behaviors** for different health thresholds

## Quick Tips

- Use the **Enemy Cloner** to quickly create variations of existing enemies
- The **Threat Calculator** shows effective combat challenge with current stats
- **Bulk Edit Mode** allows changing properties across multiple enemies
- **Test Encounters** can simulate different enemy combinations
- **Version History** tracks changes to enemies for rollback if needed

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Difficulty spikes**: Suddenly increasing challenge without proper progression
- **Empty challenges**: Creating enemies that don't require tactical thinking
- **Complexity overload**: Adding too many special abilities to a single enemy
- **Behavior inconsistency**: Making enemy actions unpredictable in unhelpful ways
- **Visual confusion**: Designs that don't properly communicate enemy capability

## Example Workflow: Creating an Alpha Naytiba

1. Open Enemy Creation Dashboard
2. Select "Alpha Naytiba" category
3. Choose "Alpha Template" template
4. Set basic properties:
   - Name: "Ravenous Behemoth"
   - Description: "A massive quadrupedal Naytiba with devastating charge attacks"
   - Visual Design: Select or import custom model
5. Set core stats:
   - Base Health: 5000
   - Attack Power: High
   - Speed: Medium-Low
   - Aggression: High
6. Define attack patterns:
   - "Ground Pound": AOE attack that creates shockwave
   - "Charging Rush": Linear charge attack that breaks defenses
   - "Tail Sweep": 270-degree attack that forces player movement
7. Add special abilities:
   - "Enraged State": Activates at 50% health, increasing speed and damage
   - "Summon Minions": Calls for reinforcements when health drops below 30%
8. Configure behavior tree:
   - Phase 1: Aggressive melee attacks mixed with charge attacks
   - Phase 2: Enraged state with faster attacks and environmental hazards
   - Phase 3: Desperate mode with minion summoning and ultimate attacks
9. Test in simulation
10. Adjust balance if needed
11. Save to enemy database

Remember that creating memorable enemies is about crafting unique combat experiences that challenge players appropriately, while maintaining a visually distinctive and thematically coherent design.

## Enemy Combat System

### Available Attack Types
- **Melee Strike**: Basic close-range attack
- **Charge Attack**: Forward rush with increased damage
- **Area Effect**: Attacks affecting a zone around the enemy
- **Projectile**: Ranged attacks with various properties
- **Grab/Throw**: Physical manipulation of the player character
- **Leap/Slam**: Vertical movement combined with area damage
- **Phase Shift**: Teleportation or rapid movement between positions
- **Summon**: Calling additional enemies to the battle

### Combat Phases

#### Health-Based Transitions
- Configure phase changes at specific health thresholds
- Modify attack patterns per phase
- Introduce new abilities at later phases
- Adjust aggression and movement speed

#### Environmental Integration
- Enable terrain interaction during combat
- Set destructible elements as combat resources
- Configure arena-specific hazards
- Script dynamic environment changes during long encounters

### Enemy Types

#### Aggressive Rushers
- **Movement Pattern**: Direct, fast approaches
- **Attack Style**: Frequent, combo-oriented strikes
- **Defense**: Limited, relies on aggression
- **Best Counter**: Parry and dodge techniques

#### Defensive Guardians
- **Movement Pattern**: Measured, position-holding
- **Attack Style**: Counter-based, punishing player mistakes
- **Defense**: Strong blocks, parries player attacks
- **Best Counter**: Breaking stance, flanking techniques

#### Ranged Specialists
- **Movement Pattern**: Evasive, distance-maintaining
- **Attack Style**: Projectile-focused with area denial
- **Defense**: Escape mechanisms when cornered
- **Best Counter**: Closing distance, reflect techniques

#### Support/Summoners
- **Movement Pattern**: Erratic, positioning for summons
- **Attack Style**: Limited direct combat, focuses on minions
- **Defense**: Shield abilities, minion protection
- **Best Counter**: Target prioritization, area attacks

### Best Practices for Combat Design

1. **Attack Telegraphing**
   - Clear visual indicators before powerful attacks
   - Animation wind-ups proportional to damage potential
   - Sound cues for off-screen threats
   - Consistent language of threat indicators

2. **Combat Pacing**
   - Mix of quick attacks and slower, devastating moves
   - Breathing room between intense sequences
   - Progressive intensity through encounter phases
   - Climactic moments tied to health thresholds

3. **Player Counters**
   - Design attacks with specific counter mechanics
   - Ensure all attack types have viable defense options
   - Reward skilled counter-play with additional damage or resources
   - Balance risk/reward for perfect parries vs. safe dodges

### Quick Tips for Enemy Combat Design

1. **Visual Communication**
   - Use color-coding for attack types (red for unblockable, etc.)
   - Distinctive animation silhouettes for different attacks
   - Clear particle effects indicating attack properties
   - Consistent visual language across enemy types

2. **Encounter Composition**
   - Mix enemy types for varied combat challenges
   - Consider encounter spaces when placing ranged units
   - Create synergies between complementary enemy types
   - Ensure challenge scales appropriately with multiple enemies

3. **Difficulty Scaling**
   - Adjust attack speed and damage rather than just health
   - Add attack variations rather than completely new attacks
   - Increase complexity of attack patterns gradually
   - Reduce telegraph time as difficulty increases

4. **Boss Design Principles**
   - Multi-phase encounters with clear transitions
   - Signature attacks that define the character
   - Arena mechanics that enhance the encounter theme
   - Recovery windows after major attack sequences

### Common Implementation Pitfalls

1. **Attack Readability**
   - Insufficient telegraph time for powerful attacks
   - Visually similar animations for different attack types
   - Unclear attack hitboxes leading to perceived unfairness
   - Excessive visual noise obscuring important cues

2. **Difficulty Balance**
   - HP sponges that extend fights without adding challenge
   - Attacks without viable counter options
   - Excessive tracking on attacks reducing dodge effectiveness
   - Undodgeable combo chains causing player frustration

3. **Combat Flow**
   - Excessive stun-locking of the player
   - Too many enemies attacking simultaneously
   - Insufficient recovery time between intense sequences
   - Repetitive attack patterns leading to predictability

### Example: Designing an Elite Naytiba Combat Sequence

```
Enemy: Abaddon (Elite Electric Naytiba)
Combat Design:
1. Phase 1 (100%-70% HP)
   - Standard melee combo attacks (3-hit sequences)
   - Telegraphed lightning bolt (area effect, 3-second charge)
   - Defensive counter when attacked during charge-up

2. Phase 2 (70%-40% HP)
   - Enhanced melee combo (4-hit sequences with final electric surge)
   - Chain lightning attack (bounces between targets)
   - Electric dash ability (quick repositioning + damage)

3. Phase 3 (40%-0% HP)
   - Desperate all-out attack mode
   - Area-wide electric field (periodic damage while active)
   - Ultimate lightning storm (major telegraphed attack requiring shelter)
```

### Example: Configuring a Minion Encounter

```
Location: Abandoned Laboratory
Encounter Composition:
1. 2x Thornhead (Melee minions)
   - Aggressive, direct approach
   - Staggered entry timing (5 seconds apart)

2. 1x Cricket Boomer (Ranged support)
   - Positioned on elevated platform
   - Prioritizes area denial attacks

3. Event Trigger at 50% Group Health:
   - Spawn 3x Creeper (Explosive minions)
   - Set to charge and self-destruct
```
